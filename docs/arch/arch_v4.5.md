**The v4.5 Bridge Architecture *is* the implementation plan for the Incremental Test Healing System.**

Think of it this way:
*   The **"Incremental Test Healing System"** diagram and concept is the *vision*—the "what we want."
*   The **"v4.5 Bridge Architecture"** is the *engineering blueprint*—the "how we build it," starting from your current codebase.

Let's break down exactly how the proposed v4.5 plan directly creates the key components of the Incremental Healing System you're excited about.

### Mapping the "Incremental Healing" Concept to the v4.5 Plan

| Incremental Healing System Feature | How v4.5 Architecture Implements It |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. The Stateful Checklist** | This is **Phase 3** of the v4.5 plan: "Evolve from In-Memory State to a Stateful Checklist." Your `PlanTestsNode` will be upgraded to produce a `test_plan_state.yaml` file with per-test statuses (`PENDING`, `PASSED`, `FAILED`). The entire workflow will now read from and write to this file, making it the durable, resilient "brain" of the operation. |
| **2. Surgical, Targeted Patches** | This is the core of **Phase 1** of the v4.5 plan: "Refactor to Interfaces." Your `HealNode` will no longer be monolithic. It will call an `IHealer` strategy that returns a structured patch object. The `post_async` logic in your *existing* `HealNode` already knows how to apply a patch to a single file. By operating on a per-test-case basis from the checklist, this existing logic becomes surgical by default. |
| **3. Incremental Execution (Run only failed tests)** | This is a natural outcome of implementing the Stateful Checklist. The main `online_flow.py` orchestrator will be modified to query the checklist for the next test case where `status` is **not** `PASSED`. This inherently prevents the system from re-running or re-generating tests that are already working, saving significant time and cost. |
| **4. Learning from History** | The v4.5 plan lays the critical foundation for this. By storing the `last_error`, `error_category`, and `patchesApplied` for each test case in the `test_plan_state.yaml`, you are creating the **dataset** required for future learning. The next step (in v5) would be to build a "PatternMatcher" that analyzes this historical data. v4.5 builds the data collection engine. |

### Before vs. After: How v4.5 Changes Everything

Let's illustrate the practical difference.

**Your Current System's Healing Loop:**

1.  `VerifyTestsNode` runs `pytest` on the **entire `tests/` directory**.
2.  `pytest` reports that `test_A` passed, but `test_B` and `test_C` failed.
3.  `HealNode` receives a big `stderr` string containing failures from both B and C.
4.  It sends this mixed context to the LLM and gets a patch. Maybe the patch fixes B but breaks A.
5.  It applies the patch.
6.  The loop repeats, re-running **all tests** (A, B, and C) again. State is lost if the process restarts.

**The v4.5 Incremental Healing Loop:**

1.  Orchestrator reads `test_plan_state.yaml`.
2.  It executes `case_A`. `ValidatorNode` runs `pytest -k test_A`. It passes.
3.  The Orchestrator updates `test_plan_state.yaml`: `case_A: { status: "PASSED" }`. **Test A is now locked and won't be touched again.**
4.  It executes `case_B`. `ValidatorNode` runs `pytest -k test_B`. It fails with an `ImportError`.
5.  The Orchestrator updates the YAML: `case_B: { status: "FAILED", last_error: "ImportError..." }`.
6.  `HealNode` is invoked **only with the context of `case_B`'s failure**.
7.  It generates a surgical patch specifically for the `ImportError`. The patch is applied.
8.  The Orchestrator updates the YAML: `case_B: { status: "RETRYING", patchesApplied: ["patch_001"] }`.
9.  The loop continues, but it will **only re-run `case_B`**. `case_A` is skipped entirely.
